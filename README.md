Demonstrating object oriented concepts in Java
/**
 *      Abstraction is when only the essential details are shown to the user. Abstract classes can contain both abstract
 * and non-abstract methods. Abstract methods do not show the implementation of the method, or in other words, they do
 * not have a body. The main advantage of using an abstract class is that similar classes can be grouped together.
 * This helps to keep a program organized and improves the readability.
 *      Inheritance is used to create classes quickly without having to code everything from scratch. Child classes can
 * inherit the attributes, methods, and constructors of the parent while also adding any needed modifications.
 * Inheritance saves time because similar classes can be made quickly and with fewer lines of code. The main
 * disadvantage of inheritance is that the classes are tightly coupled, meaning that if the parent class is changed,
 * the child class must be changed as well.
 *      Encapsulation is binding the attributes and the methods acting on the attributes together as a single unit. In
 * encapsulation, the data in a class is hidden from other classes, and can only be accessed through public methods
 * that allow the data to be accessed and changed. The main advantage of encapsulation is data-hiding. This means that
 * the implementation of the class is hidden from the user. Encapsulation also allows the attributes of a class to be
 * read-only or write-only.
 *      Polymorphism is the ability of a class to be take on multiple forms/implementations. In object oriented
 * programming, polymorphism occurs when a parent class static type is used for a child class dynamic type.
 * Polymorphism allows for specific implementations of an object through method overriding. A disadvantage of using
 * polymorphism is that is reduces readibility as it is hard to determine what the runtime type of the object is, which
 * can make debugging harder.
